A little game I'm writing to get into coding again.

How to play: Click to go up, release mouse button to go down. When ++SPECIAL++ is active, press space bar to shoot. Get as far as possible and don't crash into stuff.

How to compile: You need SDL, SDL_gfx and SDL_ttf. Then make should compile the whole thing. Try make clean if you have installed SDL after trying make for the first time.
