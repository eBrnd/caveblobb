~cavebl0bb~

A little game I'm writing to get into coding again.

How to play: Click to go up, release mouse button to go down. When ++SPECIAL++ is active, press space bar to shoot. Get as far as possible and don't crash into stuff.

If you want to post your highscores to twitter, set your browser in the .caveblobb file in your home directory. Something like "browser firefox" should do.

How to compile: You need SDL, SDL_gfx and SDL_image. Then make should compile the whole thing. Try make clean if you have installed SDL after trying make for the first time. If you still encounter linker errors, try "touch src/CMakeLists.txt".
